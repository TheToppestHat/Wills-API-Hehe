# Wills-API-Hehe
Okay my first big problem has been to switch from C# to Python from this assignment. I didn't know how to pull any data in. 
I also have had problems pulling the data back out into digestible bites. Without ToString, I have individually had to right out the data.
Okay wow the interfacing with APIs on Python is not what I was expecting, so I have had a really hard time finding out how I can separate and make finding the values easier. Unfortunately, it doesnt seem like you are able to disconnect the API JSON values without a ton of extra work, so I am just going to have to stick with my original design.
Since you gave us an extra day but I need to spend most of the day on my Anatomy midterm(ouch) I am going to touch up on some small issues and make sure it runs smooth.
